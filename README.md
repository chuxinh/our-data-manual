# Our Data Manual 📕
### 🧠 Building our data brain

Chuxin and Melody are data professionals working at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and [Ethos Life](https://www.ethoslife.com/) respectively. We live on the opposite sides of the Pacific (Sydney and San Francisco), but we share the same passion for continuing our learning in data science.

We began the project - **Our Data Manual** 📕 in late August 2021. The goal is to create a hub (*initially for our own references only*) for applied data science, machine learning, exploratory analysis and visualisations with handpicked datasets sourced from the internet.

**What's in here**
- Applied Machine Learning
- Exploratory Analysis
- Data Visualisation

**Getting started**

To clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:chuxinh/our-data-manual.git
```
